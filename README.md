### Attributions

This plugin was based on the [Resize Image After Upload](https://wordpress.org/plugins/resize-image-after-upload/) wordpress plugin.

The auto-levels filter was adapted from JavaScript, from the [auto-color-level](https://github.com/ajfarkas/auto-color-level) code by [AJ Farkas](https://github.com/ajfarkas).
